    "about": "About The Project - Capital Cities Quiz Game",
    "first": " The 'Capital Cities Quiz Game' is a dynamic and educational web-based project designed to challenge users' knowledge of global capital cities. Developed using a sophisticated technology stack, the application seamlessly integrates Angular for the front-end, Express.js and Node.js for the back-end, and PostgreSQL as the relational database management system.",
    "second": "The front-end, powered by Angular, delivers a visually appealing and responsive user interface, providing users with an immersive quiz experience. Users can seamlessly navigate through the quiz game, featuring randomly generated questions that test their knowledge of capital cities worldwide.",
    "third": "On the server side, Express.js, in conjunction with Node.js, forms a robust foundation for handling server-side logic, routing, and API creation. This combination ensures efficient communication between the user interface and the PostgreSQL database, contributing to a smooth and responsive overall experience. The back-end functionality encompasses user registration, secure login, and advanced features such as personalized user profiles for tracking quiz history and high scores. The inclusion of Express.js facilitates the creation of an interactive leaderboard, fostering healthy competition among users. Underlying the entire system is PostgreSQL, a powerful and scalable relational database management system. PostgreSQL efficiently manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, supporting essential features like user accounts, quiz history tracking, and leaderboard functionality."
